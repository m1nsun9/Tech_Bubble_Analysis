As the economy shut down and the virus spread across the country, the DOW Jones and S&P benchmark experienced the fastest ever fall after hitting record-highs in February. Since then, however, U.S. stocks have been on a winning streak that is unprecedented in the modern era of financial markets. We utilized the Financial Modeling Prep API to analyze the stark gap between the growth outlook for growth companies (75% of stock market) and that of pedestrian companies (25% of stock market). Specifically, we analyzed price changes (Year-to-Date) as well as key financial metrics and ratios per sector. Our objective was to retrieve data to conclude which sectors performed better, worse, and compare how quickly they were able to rebound from the losses suffered during the start of the pandemic. Ultimately, this analysis' aim was to prove that the stock market is a reflection of investorsâ€™ future expectations as opposed to true valuation based on current income and intrinsic value. 

# Research Questions:

1. How did each sector perform leading up to and during the pandemic? Which sectors did worse? Better?
2. How did they perform...
  - ...relative to the S&P 500 index? 
  - ...relative to the NASDAQ index? 
3. Do industry average P/E ratios align with revenue growth and current income? 
4. Finally, is this a bubble?
